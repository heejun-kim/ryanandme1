I"⁄<p>Today, I‚Äôm going to talk about my second Kakao Friends Ryan product, a 60-centimeter-tall hoody I mentioned a little bit in my last article! Hoody Ryan is like a mini-hoody Ryan‚Äôs brother, which is growing up in size in the fashionista mini doll. 
Of course, I wanted to buy a big-hoody Ryan when I bought a fashionista mini doll.,but I couldn‚Äôt make a purchase quickly because I was a university student living on pocket money from my parents at the time. However, I happened to get a giant Hoodie Ryan</p>

<p>I have a younger sister who is two years younger than me. Whenever KaKao Friends company launches a new Ryan emoticon, I always buy it for her as a gift to show Ryan‚Äôs charm. My sister often used Ryan emoticons when she was talking to her friends on messenger, so they thought she was a big fan of Kakao Friends Ryan.
So on my sister‚Äôs birthday that year, a friend who went to China with her as an exchange student gave her a big hoody Ryan doll that cost 59,000 won as a birthday present to repay her kindness.
She wasn‚Äôt as interested in Kakao Friends Ryan as I was, so I got free fashionista Mini Hoody Ryan‚Äôs brother, ‚ÄúHoorai.‚Äù (Hoorai ‚Äú is my own nickname for the hooded Ryan doll.)</p>

<p>Unlike the fashionista Mini Hoody Ryan, who gave my cousin as a gift, Hoorai is a strong oldest brother, taking good care of other Kakao Friends Ryan brothers that I‚Äôll introduce to you later. 
I‚Äôve already spent four years with the Hoorai, but there‚Äôs no major damage. I have washed about 12 times since I do it every 3 to 4 months. The hoodie that the doll is wearing isn‚Äôt stretched out or the cotton inside the doll is not damaged, so the doll‚Äôs shape is maintained well when it first came to my house.</p>

<p>The giant hoody Ryan, which first came out wearing clothes, is unfortunately out of service now.
Sometimes there‚Äôre hoody Ryans in the claw machine, so some people try to pick it out, but they‚Äôre all fake dolls. As Kakao Friends Ryan is popular, many fake products have been released since the product was launched, especially as a doll-picking product.  Well, I‚Äôm going to show you how to distinguish fakes from genuine goods.</p>

<p>The fake hoody Ryan wears a hoodie of <strong>various colors, not sky blue</strong>.  And unlike the original Kakao Friends Houdi Ryan, whose white mouth is sticking out, <strong>the fake hoody Ryan has a flat mouth</strong>.  With only these two things in mind, you can avoid buying fake Ryan dolls or pulling them out through a doll-picking machine! Make sure to <strong>buy authentic products for Kakao Friends and Ryan!</strong></p>

<p>Someone Who needs Ryan to <strong>sleep in bed together.</strong>
(If you sleep with it, you can feel comfortable )</p>

<p>Someone who wants to <strong>fill it with something in bed.</strong>
(If you put it in bed, it will fill the voids in the empty space)</p>

<p>Someone who‚Äôs looking for a strong Ryan product to be with for a long time. 
(Washing with the washing machine won‚Äôt cause any serious damage)
<strong>However, there may be personal differences.</strong></p>
