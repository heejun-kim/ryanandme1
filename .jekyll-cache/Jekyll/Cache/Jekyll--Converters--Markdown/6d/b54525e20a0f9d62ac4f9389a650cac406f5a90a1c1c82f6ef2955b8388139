<p>Hello! I am a normal 29-year-old Ryan fan who is living in Korea. Since I met Ryan in 2016, I‚Äôve been taking good care of him. A young man who was a university student in 2016 became a marketer for a startup company called ‚ÄúStudent Independence Manse‚Äù (Hakdokman) in 2018, and my desk is now decorated like this.</p>

<p>I think when I buy Ryan product, I buy it based on effectiveness  of the product. What if the people around me don‚Äôt agree?</p>

<p>As can be the name implies, <strong>Ryan is a lion</strong>. You want to know how it looks like a lion? Ryan was a male lion born <strong>without mane</strong> and the heir to the throne of DoongDoong Island. At one point, it was hard for that complex, but Ryan overcame it, and he gave up the throne for freedom and escaped DoongDoong Island. Ryan, who escaped DoongDoong Island, became <strong>a short-tailed lion because if he has long tail, then it‚Äôs easy to catch.</strong></p>

<p>It was Kakao Friends that Ryan first met after escaping from the Doong Doong Island, and it became <strong>the spiritual leader of Kakao Friends</strong> with a strong spirit that overcame the complex. The sweetness, leadership and indescribable cuteness that comes from its blunt expression are his charm, and based on these various charms, he quickly became <strong>a popular star in Korea.</strong></p>

<p>Recently, ryan has been released in Japan, China, the U.S, Europe and etc. I hope more people in foreign countries find out the Ryan‚Äôs attractive through my blog. Please look forward to the first one.</p>
