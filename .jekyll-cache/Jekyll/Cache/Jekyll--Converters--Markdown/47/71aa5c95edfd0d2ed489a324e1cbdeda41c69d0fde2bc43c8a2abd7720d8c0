I"<p>Today, I’m going to talk about my second Kakao Friends Ryan product, a 60-centimeter-tall hoody I mentioned a little bit in my last article! Hoody Ryan is like a mini-hoody Ryan’s brother, which is growing up in size in the fashionista mini doll. Of course, I wanted to buy a big-hoody Ryan when I bought a fashionista mini doll.,but I couldn’t make a purchase quickly because I was a university student living on pocket money from my parents at the time. However, I happened to get a giant Hoodie Ryan</p>
