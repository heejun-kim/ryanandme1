I"<p>Today, I’m going to talk about my second Kakao Friends Ryan product, a 60-centimeter-tall hoody I mentioned a little bit in my last article! Hoody Ryan is like a mini-hoody Ryan’s brother, which is growing up in size in the fashionista mini doll. 
Of course, I wanted to buy a big-hoody Ryan when I bought a fashionista mini doll.,but I couldn’t make a purchase quickly because I was a university student living on pocket money from my parents at the time. However, I happened to get a giant Hoodie Ryan</p>

<p>I have a younger sister who is two years younger than me. Whenever KaKao Friends company launches a new Ryan emoticon, I always buy it for her as a gift to show Ryan’s charm. My sister often used Ryan emoticons when she was talking to her friends on messenger, so they thought she was a big fan of Kakao Friends Ryan.
So on my sister’s birthday that year, a friend who went to China with her as an exchange student gave her a big hoody Ryan doll that cost 59,000 won as a birthday present to repay her kindness.
She wasn’t as interested in Kakao Friends Ryan as I was, so I got free fashionista Mini Hoody Ryan’s brother, “Hoorai.” (Hoorai “ is my own nickname for the hooded Ryan doll.)</p>

<p>Unlike the fashionista Mini Hoody Ryan, who gave my cousin as a gift, Hoorai is a strong oldest brother, taking good care of other Kakao Friends Ryan brothers that I’ll introduce to you later. 
I’ve already spent four years with the Hoorai, but there’s no major damage. I have washed about 12 times since I do it every 3 to 4 months. The hoodie that the doll is wearing isn’t stretched out or the cotton inside the doll is not damaged, so the doll’s shape is maintained well when it first came to my house.</p>

<p>The giant hoody Ryan, which first came out wearing clothes, is unfortunately out of service now.
Sometimes there’re hoody Ryans in the claw machine, so some people try to pick it out, but they’re all fake dolls. As Kakao Friends Ryan is popular, many fake products have been released since the product was launched, especially as a doll-picking product.  Well, I’m going to show you how to distinguish fakes from genuine goods.</p>
