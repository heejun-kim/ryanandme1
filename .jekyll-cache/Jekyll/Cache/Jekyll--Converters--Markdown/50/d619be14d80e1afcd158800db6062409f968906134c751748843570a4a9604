I"ô<p>Today, I‚Äôm going to talk about my second Kakao Friends Ryan product, a 60-centimeter-tall hoody I mentioned a little bit in my last article! Hoody Ryan is like a mini-hoody Ryan‚Äôs brother, which is growing up in size in the fashionista mini doll. Of course, I wanted to buy a big-hoody Ryan when I bought a fashionista mini doll.,but I couldn‚Äôt make a purchase quickly because I was a university student living on pocket money from my parents at the time. However, I happened to get a giant Hoodie Ryan</p>

<p>I have a younger sister who is two years younger than me. Whenever KaKao Friends company launches a new Ryan emoticon, I always buy it for her as a gift to show Ryan‚Äôs charm. My sister often used Ryan emoticons when she was talking to her friends on messenger, so they thought she was a big fan of Kakao Friends Ryan.
So on my sister‚Äôs birthday that year, a friend who went to China with her as an exchange student gave her a big hoody Ryan doll that cost 59,000 won as a birthday present to repay her kindness.
She wasn‚Äôt as interested in Kakao Friends Ryan as I was, so I got free fashionista Mini Hoody Ryan‚Äôs brother, ‚ÄúHoorai.‚Äù (Hoorai ‚Äú is my own nickname for the hooded Ryan doll.)</p>

<p>I mentioned above that the Kakao Friends fashionista mini doll was out of stock at the time of its launch. At that time, I pressed the refresh button at the online shop every day to buy the mini hoodie Ryan doll. I really wanted to have it so much that I was pressing the Refresh button while I was listening to the Analysis of accounting lecture and I was finally able to make a purchase. It was a strong memory,although It‚Äôs been 3 years but I still remember what classes I was taking!</p>

<p>The reason why I first bought Kakao Friends Mini Hoodie Ryan was to put it on my bag. There‚Äôs a lot of Ryan goods you can put in your bag right now, but there were no products at the time! But I couldn‚Äôt put the ring in my bag, so I gave up carrying the Ryan doll in my bag. So since then, I‚Äôve put it next to my bed.It‚Äôs so small that I remember starting my day by picking up a mini hoodie Ryan doll when I woke up.</p>

<p>Now I want to show you the KaKao Friends mini fashionista Ryan doll, but unfortunately I can‚Äôt. Did I throw it away? No! My mini hoodie Ryan doll was adopted by my cousin about three months after the purchase. Because it was very popular and popular with children as well as adults like me. So I sent Ryan to join me for my grieving cousin because he was not here. Now It‚Äôs in the corner of my cousin‚Äôs room.</p>
