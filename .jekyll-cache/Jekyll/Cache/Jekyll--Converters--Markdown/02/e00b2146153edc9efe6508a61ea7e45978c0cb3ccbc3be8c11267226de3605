I"„<p>The Ryan Iâ€™m going to introduce today is not the one I bought myself. I got this doll as a gift from a Jundu, who is a COO and a co-founder of my startup company.  I didnâ€™t get it as a birthday present, but I got it as a first-place quiz on Culture Day.</p>

<p>What is <strong>Culture Day</strong>? In Korea, the last Wednesday of every month is designated as Culture Day, and admission to museums and national performance institutions is free of charge, and tickets to movie theaters are discounted. Itâ€™s a bit unique, right? At this time, the employees of my company take turns in each month to decide the topic and enjoy Culture Day together. Of course, participation is freedom, not coercion! Unlike other conservative companies in Korea, it is a very horizontal and free startup.</p>

<p>The theme of Culture Day in March 19 was to write a questionnaire describing each other and learn more about each other with a quiz based on it. Here, I won the first place based on my average marketerâ€™s ability to observe people. Of course I asked for Ryan as the first prize, and Jundu, the COO, bought me a <strong>Flying Ryan doll.</strong></p>

<p>I just didnâ€™t ask for anything, but my coo, Jundu, bought me a Flying Ryan doll because of the companyâ€™s situation at that time. HDM(hakdokman) is a company that implements <strong>ISA (shortened income share agreement )</strong> that is actively located in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the United States, most pioneering and innovatively in Korea. 
At that time, unlike other countries, we first started our service as an <strong>air ground education</strong> business and we were expanding. So, Jundu said he gave me Flying Ryan as a present in the hope that the air ground-based education business would do well. Thanks to his wishes, our company has been innovating the education market in Korea by providing income share agreement to education businesses in areas such as <strong>digital marketing, coding, UXUI and motion graphics</strong> based on the success of the ground-based education business as of 2019.</p>

<p>Flying Ryan is more than just Ryan, to me, like an amulet for success. So, Flying Ryan is with me outside as well as at home. The doll of the airplane is not with me, but <strong>the pilot Ryan doll that is separated from the airplane doll is small and acts as a bag keyring</strong>, so if it doesnâ€™t rain or snow, it is with me. Flying Ryan is a Ryan product that can have the effect of getting a two-legged Ryan doll that you can put on a bed and attach to the bag. Itâ€™s a little bit bland if you take the pilot Ryan doll off the plane. However, because the front part of the doll is painted with a Ryan character, that alone has enough value as a Ryan. I donâ€™t know how to wash it because I havenâ€™t taken a bath. But the wing of the doll looks a little unique, and itâ€™s not made of doll material, so I try not to touch it.</p>
