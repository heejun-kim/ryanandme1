I"S<p>Today, I’m going to talk about the first Kakao Friends Ryan product I bought. Actually, the first one I bought was Ryan Emoticon of Kakao Talk messenger, but if it’s a product, it’s the first Ryan I’m going to talk about. It’s a <strong>Ryan Fashionista mini doll</strong> that was out of stock at the time of its launch.</p>
