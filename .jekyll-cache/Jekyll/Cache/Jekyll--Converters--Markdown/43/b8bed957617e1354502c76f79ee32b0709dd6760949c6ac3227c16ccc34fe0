<p>Hello! New Year is here in Korea where I live! So I took a picture of the family of the KaKao Friends Ryan family with me in the New Year. In this picture, there are ryan dolls that youâ€™ve already seen, and there are Lion dolls that you havenâ€™t seen, and Iâ€™ll do my best to introduce you to my Kakao Friends Ryan in 2020. I wish you all the best in the New Year and good luck in 2020. Thank you.</p>
