Today, I'm going to talk about the first Kakao Friends Ryan product I bought. Actually, the first one I bought was Ryan Emoticon of Kakao Talk messenger, but if it's a product, it's the first Ryan I'm going to talk about. It's a **Ryan Fashionista mini doll** that was out of stock at the time of its launch.

The Kakao Friends Ryan Fashionista mini doll is a mini version of the 60-centimeter hoodie Ryan doll, and it's the first Ryan doll to be dressed with the hoodie. Ryan, released before that, is all naked Ryan. At that time, the hoodie Ryan was called **"HoodieRyan, HoodRyan"** and is still available in various products including cell phone cases, figures, ballpoint pens, etc.

I mentioned above that the Kakao Friends fashionista mini doll was out of stock at the time of its launch. At that time, I pressed the refresh button at the online shop every day to buy the mini hoodie Ryan doll. I really wanted to have it so much that I was pressing the Refresh button while I was listening to the Analysis of accounting lecture and I was finally able to make a purchase. It was a strong memory,although It's been 3 years but I still remember what classes I was taking!

The reason why I first bought Kakao Friends Mini Hoodie Ryan was to put it on my bag. There's a lot of Ryan goods you can put in your bag right now, but there were no products at the time! But I couldn't put the ring in my bag, so I gave up carrying the Ryan doll in my bag. So since then, I've put it next to my bed.It's so small that I remember starting my day by picking up a mini hoodie Ryan doll when I woke up.

Now I want to show you the KaKao Friends mini fashionista Ryan doll, but unfortunately I can't. Did I throw it away? No! My mini hoodie Ryan doll was adopted by my cousin about three months after the purchase. Because it was very popular and popular with children as well as adults like me. So I sent Ryan to join me for my grieving cousin because he was not here. Now It's in the corner of my cousin's room.
